1. When implementing the elimination of bricks we chose to send the instance of our gameManager to the
brickCollisionStrategy.

- The advantages are:
We are delegating the right responsibilities to each class, the game manager does it's job - deleting the
bricks from render, and how he does it is the manager's business, not the brick's.
We don't have to send tens of variables since the manager has getters for all the relevant data.

- The disadvantages are:
We are giving the brick class more than it needs, the brick class suddenly has the power to manage the whole
game through the gameManager, while it needs only a part of all of managers functionality.
It also creates a circular relationship between the classes, the game manager has the game which has the
bricks which have the game manager - it's unintuitive.


2. In the implementation, we created the 'LivesBar' class to manage graphical representation of player's lives
using heart objects from 'Heart' class, and the numerical representation is managed using the 'TextRenderable'
class. The BrickerGameManager class manages these elements, updating them based on changes in player's
lives count and handling logic for increasing and decreasing lives.



3. To implement the special behaviors, we utilized specific collision strategies tailored to each. The
AddPaddleCollisionStrategy class creates an extra paddle object from 'ExtraPaddle' class.
Similarly, the AddHeartCollisionStrategy class generates a heart token object from 'HeartToken' class that
on impact with the paddle gains the player an extra life. The AddPuckCollisionStrategy class creates
multiple pucks objects from 'Puck' class. And the ChangeCameraCollisionStrategy class dynamically adjusts the
camera behavior, and uses an object from 'CameraReverter' class to determine when to change the camera back to
normal.



4. We chose a relatively simple approach to this problem, while we could've done some decorator trickery, we
chose to look at this problem this way: Suppose we get a double behavior in the brick, in the end it should
result in two "regular" behaviors. So we randomise a number corresponding to the behavior factory integer to
generate a certain behavior, if we get the number that creates another double behavior, we just roll two
other, more "regular" behaviors. if we didn't get a double behavior on the roll, we do it again.
At the end of the day, we turn the double behavior into the number of more normal behaviors we want to
generate. This approach saves us the need to create more instances of strategies.

At BrickerGameManager:

increaseLives() method: Added so the manager does this functionality but the heart token could call for it.
addObjectToRender(),addObjectToRender() methods: Again, manager implements the rendering of objects, but it
has to be called in other objects and strategies.
setCameraToFollowBall() method: used by the camera follow strat, managed by the manager as it should.
revertCamera() method: the camera has to be set back after a timer/counter which is implemented in other
classes.
setExtraPaddle() method: sets the extra paddle if required by a strategy.
removeBrick() method: removes the brick from the rendering queue, called by basically all brick collision
strats.
+ a lot of getters for variables needed by other classes.

At Paddle:
getGameManager() method: is used by the ExtraPaddle since it inherits from the Paddle class.

Added gameConstants at bricker.constants:
Basically extracted all the consts to this module to edit them easily, as is good practice

classes LivesBar and Heart are objects in implementation of lives UI.

HeartToken inherits the Heart with additional functionality since its no longer just a UI representation.

ExtraPaddle inherits from the Paddle class an adds functionality.
