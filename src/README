1. When implementing the elimination of bricks we chose to send the instance of our gameManager to the
brickCollisionStrategy. The advantages are: ___. The disadvantages are: ___.
2. In the implementation, we created the 'LivesBar' class to manage graphical representation of player's lives
using heart objects from 'Heart' class, and the numerical representation is managed using the 'TextRenderable'
class. The BrickerGameManager class orchestrates these elements, updating them based on changes in player's
lives count and handling logic for increasing and decreasing lives.
3. To implement the special behaviors, we utilized specific collision strategies tailored to each. The
AddPaddleCollisionStrategy class creates an extra paddle object from 'ExtraPaddle' class.
Similarly, the AddHeartCollisionStrategy class generates a heart token object from 'HeartToken' class that
upon impact with the paddle gains the player an extra life. The AddPuckCollisionStrategy class creates
multiple pucks objects from 'Puck' class. And the ChangeCameraCollisionStrategy class dynamically adjusts the
camera behavior, and uses an object from 'CameraReverter' class to determine when to change the camera back to
normal.
